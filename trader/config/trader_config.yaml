    # HYBRID STRATEGY: Momentum Breakout + Pullback/Retest (Oct 4, 2025)
    # Two entry types based on breakout strength:
    # 1. MOMENTUM: Strong volume + large candle = immediate entry (no pullback needed)
    # 2. PULLBACK: Weak initial break = wait for pullback/retest

    candle_timeframe_seconds: 60    # 60 seconds = 1-minute candles

    # MOMENTUM BREAKOUT thresholds (immediate entry, no pullback)
    # Updated Oct 7, 2025: Volume-only filter (RSI/MACD removed - too slow for intraday)
    momentum_volume_threshold: 2.0          # Volume ≥2.0x average = strong momentum
    momentum_candle_min_pct: 0.000          # DISABLED - no candle size requirement
    momentum_candle_min_atr: 0.0            # DISABLED - no ATR requirement

    # PULLBACK/RETEST thresholds (patient entry for weak initial breaks)
    # FIXES (Oct 15, 2025): Strengthened to prevent weak retests of stale breakouts

    pullback_distance_pct: 0.003            # Must pullback within 0.3% of pivot
    max_pullback_bars: 24                   # Max 2 minutes (24 × 5-sec bars) to retest
    pullback_volume_threshold: 2.0          # ✅ RAISED from 1.2 to 2.0 - require strong confirmation on retest
    pullback_candle_min_pct: 0.005          # ✅ NEW: Require 0.5% minimum candle size (0.0% candles blocked)
    max_retest_time_minutes: 30             # ✅ NEW: Only allow retests within 30 min of initial break (prevent stale entries)

    # SUSTAINED BREAK logic (Oct 5, 2025) - Alternative for slow grind breakouts
    # Catches PLTR-type setups: weak candle but sustained hold with volume
    sustained_break_enabled: true           # Enable sustained break detection
    sustained_break_minutes: 1              # Must hold above/below pivot for 1 minute (reduced from 2 - Oct 9 state machine fix)

    # ENTRY QUALITY FILTERS (Applied during entry decision)
    # --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    # RANGE-BASED CHASING FILTER (Oct 4, 2025) - For MOMENTUM entries only
    # Purpose: Prevent entering momentum breakouts when already at top of range
    # When: Checked for MOMENTUM entries ONLY (not pullback/sustained)
    # How: Measures entry position as % of recent 5-minute range
    # Impact: Winners entered at 36% of range, losers at 81%
    # Note: Pullback/sustained use room-to-run filter instead
    enable_entry_position_filter: false     # DISABLED - superseded by room-to-run filter
    max_entry_position_pct: 70              # Don't enter above 70% of 5-min range
    entry_position_lookback_bars: 60        # 5 minutes (60 × 5-sec bars)

    # CHOPPY MARKET FILTER (Oct 4, 2025) ⭐ CRITICAL
    # Purpose: Avoid entering during consolidation/sideways markets (high whipsaw risk)
    # When: Checked for ALL entry types (momentum, pullback, sustained)
    # How: Compares recent 5-min range to ATR (volatility measure)
    # Impact: 61% of losses came from choppy conditions, lost $15,425 in one week
    # Logic: If range < 0.5× ATR → CHOPPY (block), else TRENDING (allow)
    # Documentation: See FILTER_DOCUMENTATION.md "Choppy Market Filter"
    enable_choppy_filter: true              # ENABLED - prevents consolidation entries
    choppy_atr_multiplier: 0.5              # Recent range must be >0.5× ATR
    choppy_lookback_bars: 60                # 5 minutes (60 × 5-sec bars)

  # Setup types to trade
  setup_types:

  max_dist_to_pivot: 100.0     # Max distance to pivot % (100 = disabled)

  # ENHANCED SCORING FILTERS (Oct 6, 2025) ⭐ NEW
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Based on validation showing 70% accuracy in top 10 ranked setups
  # These filters apply when using enhanced scoring CSV (rescored_YYYYMMDD.csv)

  # Enhanced score thresholds
  min_enhanced_score: 85       # Minimum enhanced score (0-100+)
                               # 85+ captures top-tier setups
                               # TIER 1 stocks typically score 100
                               # TIER 2 stocks typically score 85-100

  # Pivot width filter (KEY INSIGHT: tight pivots = winners)
  # Winners averaged 2.51% pivot width vs 4.92% for false breakouts
  min_pivot_width_pct: 0.0     # Minimum pivot width % (0 = no min)
  max_pivot_width_pct: 5.0     # Maximum pivot width %
                               # 5.0% = avoid very wide pivots (high false breakout risk)
                               # Per validation: >5% = likely false breakout

  # Test count filter (KEY INSIGHT: heavily tested = higher success)
  # Tested ≥10x = 80% success rate, <5x = 47% success rate
  min_test_count: 5            # Minimum number of times resistance/support tested
                               # 5+ = 58% success rate
                               # 10+ = 80% success rate (TIER 1)

  # Tier-based filtering
  tier_filter:                 # Which tiers to trade
    - 'TIER 1'                 # Always trade (70-80% expected success)
    - 'TIER 2'                 # Trade with normal position size (50-60% success)
    - 'TIER 3'                 # Trade selectively (40-50% success)
    # 'AVOID' tier is never traded (blacklisted or too wide pivots)

  # GAP FILTER (Overnight gap detection)
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Purpose: Skip trades where overnight gaps ate up the move
  # When: Checked at market open before monitoring begins
  # Impact: Prevents entering setups with insufficient room after gaps
  # Documentation: See CLAUDE.md "Gap Handling" section
  enable_gap_filter: false     # DISABLED for testing
  max_gap_through_pivot: 1.0   # Max 1% gap through pivot (small gap OK)
  min_room_to_target: 3.0      # Min 3% room to target after gap

  # ROOM-TO-RUN FILTER (Oct 5, 2025) ⭐ NEW
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Purpose: Ensure sufficient room to target at entry time
  # When: Checked for pullback/retest and sustained break entries ONLY
  #       NOT checked for momentum entries (immediate entries don't need this)
  # How: Calculates (target - entry_price) / entry_price as percentage
  # Impact: Blocks marginal setups where confirmation delay ate the move
  # Example: PLTR Oct 1 had 0.61% room vs 1.5% minimum → BLOCKED
  # Documentation: See FILTER_DOCUMENTATION.md "Room-to-Run Filter"
  enable_room_to_run_filter: true

                               # Entry $100, Target $103 = 3.0% → ALLOW

  # ENTRY POSITION FILTER (Oct 15, 2025) ⭐ NEW
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Purpose: Prevent entering too far above resistance (chasing stale retests)
  # When: Checked for ALL entry types during pullback/retest confirmation
  # How: Blocks if entry_price > pivot_price * (1 + max_entry_above_resistance)
  # Impact: Prevents chasing stocks that already moved away from breakout
  # Example: GM resistance $57.45, entry $57.79 (+0.59%) → BLOCKED if max=0.003
  max_entry_above_resistance: 0.003  # ✅ NEW: Don't enter >0.3% above pivot for LONGS
  max_entry_below_support: 0.003     # ✅ NEW: Don't enter >0.3% below pivot for SHORTS

  # SYMBOL FILTERS (Blacklist/Whitelist)
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Purpose: Avoid specific symbols or categories with poor characteristics
  # When: Checked during watchlist filtering
  # Impact: Completely removes symbols from consideration
  avoid_index_shorts: true     # Skip SPY/QQQ/DIA shorts (saved $700/day in backtest)
  avoid_symbols:               # Complete blacklist
    - "SPY"    # Index ETFs - too choppy, whipsaw frequently
    - "QQQ"
    - "DIA"
    - "IWM"

# STOCHASTIC OSCILLATOR FILTER (Oct 15, 2025) ⭐ NEW
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose: Confirm momentum and avoid overbought/oversold entries
# Uses: Hourly bars with 21-period lookback (Stochastic 21, 1, 3)
# LONG entries: %K must be between 60-80 (momentum zone, not overbought)
# SHORT entries: %K must be between 20-50 (momentum zone, not oversold)
# Applied to: ALL entry paths (momentum, pullback, sustained)
