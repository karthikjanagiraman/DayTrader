  # ===== DYNAMIC RESISTANCE EXITS (Oct 15, 2025) =====
  # NEW: Take partials when approaching technical resistance levels
  # Uses hourly SMAs, Bollinger Bands, and Linear Regression channels
  # Smarter than fixed 1% trailing - respects actual market structure
  # Example: SOFI $28.55 entry → detect SMA50 @ $28.85 → take 25% partial, trail remainder

  # ===== TARGET-HIT STALL DETECTION (Oct 21, 2025 - Phase 9) =====
  # NEW: Detect when price stalls after hitting target1, tighten trail to exit quickly
  # Problem: After target hit, price often consolidates/ranges for extended periods
  #          Holding 50% runner for 90 min earning $3 = capital inefficiency
  # Solution: Detect stall (tight range for N minutes) → tighten trail to 0.1%
  # Example: PATH hit target1 $16.42, ranged $16.40-$16.42 for 86 min → exit at $16.34
  #          With stall detection: Exit at $16.40 after 5 min → 7x better P&L on runner

    # ENTRY QUALITY FILTERS (Applied during entry decision)
    # --------------------------------------------------------------------------

    # RANGE-BASED CHASING FILTER (Oct 4, 2025) - For MOMENTUM entries only
    # Purpose: Prevent entering momentum breakouts when already at top of range
    # When: Checked for MOMENTUM entries ONLY (not pullback/sustained)
    # How: Measures entry position as % of recent 5-minute range
    # Impact: Winners entered at 36% of range, losers at 81%
    # Note: Pullback/sustained use room-to-run filter instead
    enable_entry_position_filter: false     # DISABLED - superseded by room-to-run filter

    # CHOPPY MARKET FILTER (Oct 4, 2025) ⭐ CRITICAL
    # Purpose: Avoid entering during consolidation/sideways markets (high whipsaw risk)
    # When: Checked for ALL entry types (momentum, pullback, sustained)
    # How: Compares recent 5-min range to ATR (volatility measure)
    # Impact: 61% of losses came from choppy conditions, lost $15,425 in one week
    # Logic: If range < 0.5× ATR → CHOPPY (block), else TRENDING (allow)
    # Documentation: See FILTER_DOCUMENTATION.md "Choppy Market Filter"

  # ENHANCED SCORING FILTERS (Oct 6, 2025) ⭐ NEW
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Based on validation showing 70% accuracy in top 10 ranked setups
  # These filters apply when using enhanced scoring CSV (rescored_YYYYMMDD.csv)

  # Enhanced score thresholds
  min_enhanced_score: 85       # Minimum enhanced score (0-100+)
                               # 85+ captures top-tier setups

  min_pivot_width_pct: 0.0     # Minimum pivot width % (0 = no min)
  max_pivot_width_pct: 5.0     # Maximum pivot width %
                               # 5.0% = avoid very wide pivots (high false breakout risk)
                               # Per validation: >5% = likely false breakout

    # 'AVOID' tier is never traded (blacklisted or too wide pivots)

  # GAP FILTER (Overnight gap detection)
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Purpose: Skip trades where overnight gaps ate up the move
  # When: Checked at market open before monitoring begins

  # Purpose: Ensure sufficient room to target at entry time
  # When: Checked for pullback/retest and sustained break entries ONLY
  #       NOT checked for momentum entries (immediate entries don't need this)
  # How: Calculates (target - entry_price) / entry_price as percentage
  # Impact: Blocks marginal setups where confirmation delay ate the move
  # Example: PLTR Oct 1 had 0.61% room vs 1.5% minimum → BLOCKED

  # ENTRY POSITION FILTER (Oct 15, 2025) ⭐ NEW
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Purpose: Prevent entering too far above resistance (chasing stale retests)
  # When: Checked for ALL entry types during pullback/retest confirmation
  # How: Blocks if entry_price > pivot_price * (1 + max_entry_above_resistance)
  # Impact: Prevents chasing stocks that already moved away from breakout
  # Example: GM resistance $57.45, entry $57.79 (+0.59%) → BLOCKED if max=0.003
  max_entry_above_resistance: 0.003  # ✅ NEW: Don't enter >0.3% above pivot for LONGS
  max_entry_below_support: 0.003     # ✅ NEW: Don't enter >0.3% below pivot for SHORTS

  # SYMBOL FILTERS (Blacklist/Whitelist)
  # ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  # Purpose: Avoid specific symbols or categories with poor characteristics
  # When: Checked during watchlist filtering
  # Impact: Completely removes symbols from consideration

# CVD (CUMULATIVE VOLUME DELTA) FILTER (Oct 21, 2025) ⭐ CONTINUOUS MONITORING
# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Purpose: Validate breakout quality by measuring buying vs selling pressure
# Uses: Bar approximation (backtesting) or tick data (live trading)
# LONG entries: CVD trend must be BULLISH (positive slope = net buying)
# SHORT entries: CVD trend must be BEARISH (negative slope = net selling)
# Applied to: CONTINUOUSLY monitored after breakout for up to 10 minutes
#
# NEW APPROACH (Oct 21, 2025): Continuous CVD Monitoring
# - After breakout detection, enter "CVD_MONITORING" state
# - Check CVD on EVERY 1-minute candle close
# - TWO ENTRY PATHS:
#   1. AGGRESSIVE: CVD slope ≥ 2000 → enter immediately (strong buying spike)
#   2. PATIENT: CVD slope ≥ 1000 for 2+ consecutive candles → enter (sustained buying)
# - Reset consecutive counter if CVD drops below threshold
# - Timeout after 10 minutes without confirmation
#
# How CVD works:
# - Measures cumulative difference between buying volume and selling volume
# - Bar approximation: Close in upper half of range = buying, lower half = selling
# - Tick data (live): Upticks = buying, downticks = selling
# - Slope calculation: Linear regression over last N bars
# - Trend classification: Slope > +1000 = BULLISH, < -1000 = BEARISH
#
# Why continuous monitoring is better:
# - Doesn't miss CVD confirmation that appears on candle 3, 4, 5, etc.
# - More flexible than fixed 2-candle check
# - Finds best entry timing within 10-minute window
#
# Configuration:

    check_every_candle: true                 # Check on EVERY 1-min candle close

    # PATH 2: Sustained CVD (consecutive candles) - PATIENT ENTRY
    min_consecutive_bullish: 3               # ⭐ INCREASED: 3 consecutive bullish candles for LONG (Oct 21, 2025)
    min_consecutive_bearish: 3               # ⭐ INCREASED: 3 consecutive bearish candles for SHORT (Oct 21, 2025)

    # ===== PHASE 1 FIX (Oct 22, 2025): PERCENTAGE-BASED IMBALANCE =====
    # NEW: Use percentage imbalance instead of absolute slope thresholds
    # Solves the problem: Each stock has different volume ranges
    # Example: TSLA 41,710 volume → 14.5% imbalance → BEARISH
    #          Low-vol stock 1,000 volume → 14.5% imbalance → BEARISH (same!)
    # Formula: imbalance_pct = (sell_volume - buy_volume) / total_volume * 100
    #   Positive = more selling (BEARISH), Negative = more buying (BULLISH)

    # Sustained CVD threshold (consecutive candles) - PATH 2 (PATIENT)
    imbalance_threshold: 10.0                 # ⭐ PHASE 11 MIDDLE-GROUND (Oct 26, 2025): 2% sustained imbalance
                                             # For LONG: 3 consecutive candles with ≥2% buying pressure
                                             # For SHORT: 3 consecutive candles with ≥2% selling pressure
                                             # Balanced approach: Not too strict (10%) or too loose (0.1%)
                                             # Other filters (volume, price, stochastic, room-to-run) provide validation

    # PATH 1: Strong CVD spike (aggressive path with confirmation) - AGGRESSIVE ENTRY
    # Requires BOTH: Initial spike + confirmation candle
    strong_imbalance_threshold: 20.0         # ⭐ PHASE 11 MIDDLE-GROUND (Oct 26, 2025): >10% imbalance on initial candle
                                             # Initial candle must be >10%, PLUS next candle >5% to confirm
    strong_confirmation_threshold: 10.0       # ⭐ PHASE 11 MIDDLE-GROUND (Oct 26, 2025): Next candle must show >5% imbalance
                                             # Volume spike + strong CVD confirmation = high-quality entry
