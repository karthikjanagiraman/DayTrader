📈 RECOMMENDATIONS
-----------------
1. ✅ Place stops 0.25% below pivot (not at pivot)
   - Survives normal consolidation retests
   - Maintains strong R/R ratio (3-4:1)

2. ⚠️  Consider skipping trades on choppy days
   - No clean breakouts = low conviction
   - Higher false breakout rate

3. ✅ Accept 1-2 retests as normal
   - Both winners had retests (MODERATE quality)
   - Don't exit on first retest

4. ❌ Avoid CHOPPY setups (3+ retests historically)
   - Could add historical retest count as scanner filter

5. 📊 Oct 21 was a difficult trading day
   - Only 28.6% success rate
   - Consider daily market condition filters
