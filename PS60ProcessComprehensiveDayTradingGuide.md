# **Dan Shapiro’s “PS60 Process” – Comprehensive Day Trading Guide**


## **Executive Summary**

Dan Shapiro’s **PS60 Process** is a systematic day-trading methodology built around **60-minute price pivots**. The core idea is that stocks move from **supply to supply** (resistance to resistance) or **demand to demand** (support to support) levels, as identified by key moving averages and technical indicators. By focusing on just *six or seven hourly candles* per trading day – instead of the noise of hundreds of 1-minute bars – traders can clearly spot high-probability setups with well-defined entry and exit points. Each hourly candle’s high or low acts as a *pivot level*: once **confirmed** (i.e. breached by the next hour’s candle), it can trigger a long or short trade in the direction of the break.

The PS60 Process combines **technical analysis** (multi-timeframe moving averages, Bollinger Bands, etc.) with a rigorous **trade execution plan** and risk management rules. Traders wait patiently for **hourly pivots** to break, enter on confirmation, take **partial profits** quickly, and then move stops to breakeven – creating a psychological edge by minimizing risk exposure. A unique element is the *“5-7 minute rule”*: if a trade fails to move in your favor within the first 5–7 minutes after entry, assume a hidden **“reload” seller or buyer** is present and cut the trade to avoid a larger loss.

This guide distills the **PS60 trading process** from theory through practice. It covers the guiding principles of supply/demand pivots and hourly confirmation, the exact chart setup (indicators and platforms), a detailed playbook for both long and short setups (from the opening range breakout to intraday continuations and gap adjustments), strict risk-management rules, and real trade examples with 60-min charts illustrating each scenario. A glossary of PS60 terminology and cheat sheets (including a decision flowchart and risk management quick-reference) are provided to cement understanding. By internalizing this process and its rules, traders can eliminate guesswork and emotional decision-making, trading with confidence and consistency in any market condition.

*(Note: The PS60 Process is **not an alert service** – it requires traders to learn the methodology and apply it to their own screens. This documentation compiles public insights from Dan Shapiro (founder of Access A Trader) and his community, as referenced throughout.)*

## **Theory & Principles**

**Supply & Demand Theory:** Every line on the chart (e.g. a major moving average or a Bollinger Band boundary) represents a potential **supply zone (resistance)** or **demand zone (support)** where stock movement may stall or reverse. The PS60 theory assumes that a stock in motion will seek the next supply if rising, or the next demand if falling. Trades are only taken when there is **“air” to the next technical level** – i.e. sufficient room for the trade to profit before hitting a known supply/demand obstacle. If a stock is about to run into a major moving average or band just above the pivot, the setup is usually skipped (“not every stock is tradeable” at every moment). This built-in filter greatly increases probability of success by avoiding low-reward trades that would “run into a wall” of supply or demand immediately.

**Alignment of Timeframes:** PS60 emphasizes **multi-timeframe alignment**, primarily between the daily chart and the 60-min chart. A common setup is when a stock has a bullish daily chart pattern (e.g. a tight base or breakout setup) and also presents a clear intraday pivot on the 60-min chart. The nightly preparation (discussed later) involves scanning daily charts for setups that *fit the PS60 criteria*, then watching the 60-min candles next day for triggers. The trade is only valid if both timeframes agree and neither shows an impending supply/demand barrier in the near distance.

**Psychological Edge:** By pre-defining levels and waiting for confirmation, the PS60 Process gives the trader a **psychological edge**. There’s no need to predict or jump early; you let the market tip its hand. This reduces impulsive entries and the anxiety of “where do I get in?” – the level is identified in advance. Moreover, because initial **profit is taken quickly** (often on the first push after the pivot breaks) and stops are moved to breakeven, traders gain confidence that they are playing with “house money” on the remainder of the position. This approach combats the fear of giving back profits and the tendency to hold losers too long. Shapiro often stresses that **trading is a game of staying in business** – by cutting losers fast and riding only those trades that prove themselves, you protect both capital and mental capital. The strict stop discipline (including the 5-minute timer for high-momentum names) prevents the common mistake of hope-based holding. In essence, the PS60 Process imposes *structure and rules* on the trader, helping overcome emotional reactions with a clear plan.

**Hourly Channel vs. One-Minute Noise:** Most day traders get caught up in micro-fluctuations; PS60 flips the script by zooming out to the hourly **channel**. By tracking only hourly pivot points, one naturally filters out the “retail noise” and false moves that occur on lower timeframes. As the Access A Trader team puts it, the PS60 Process “bases setups off only 6 hourly candles each day as opposed to 320 one-minute candles” – leading to a *clean, uncluttered view* and clear levels known ahead of time. This structured approach is unique: *“No one else on the planet trades this way…except us.”* While an hourly focus might seem slow to adrenaline-fueled scalpers, it actually enables **faster decision-making** once a pivot triggers – because all the analysis (levels, bias, risk) was done in advance. When that moment comes, you simply execute the plan.

In summary, the PS60 Process rests on the **foundation of price-action truth**: stocks tend to respect well-defined technical levels. By observing 60-minute price action, identifying the **supply/demand pivot**, and only trading on confirmed breaks (with room to next support/resistance), a trader can achieve greater consistency. The process is **rinse and repeat**: each day provides new pivots and opportunities to apply the same rules. It’s a method that simplifies trading decisions to a handful of crucial moments each day, letting you ignore the chaos in between.

## **Chart-Setup Checklist**

To properly apply PS60, you must configure your charts with the correct indicators and settings. Dan Shapiro’s recommended chart setup is as follows:

* **Time Frame:** 60-minute candlestick chart (preferably with extended hours **excluded** or clearly indicated, since pivots consider regular session highs/lows unless otherwise noted). The first hour candle of the day will span the opening 9:30am to 10:30am (ET) period – this initial candle often sets the **Opening Range** pivot levels.

* **Moving Averages:** Plot a comprehensive array of both **Simple Moving Averages (SMAs)** and **Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs)** on the chart. Specifically, Shapiro uses:  
   – SMAs: **5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200** period SMA  
   – EMAs: **4, 9, 10, 13, 20, 50, 100, 200** period EMA  
   These multiple MAs (some traders use a subset like 5/10/20/50 etc.) act as the aforementioned supply/demand zones on the 60-min timeframe. Many practitioners color-code the averages for clarity (e.g. shorter MAs in brighter colors). In fact, some have created **“MA cloud” indicators** to group overlapping averages and reduce chart clutter. Ensure you use consistent colors so you can quickly identify, for example, the 200 MA vs the 20 MA on your chart.

* **Bollinger Bands:** Add a standard **20-period Bollinger Band (20,2)**. Bollinger Bands help identify volatility contractions/expansions and also serve as dynamic support/resistance. In PS60, the outer Bollinger bands often act like additional supply/demand levels – for instance, a stock hitting the upper 60m band might be at short-term **supply** (overbought in that timeframe), and vice versa for the lower band (short-term demand). Tight Bollinger bandwidth can indicate a coiled setup (low volatility preceding a breakout).

* **Linear Regression Line:** Add a **30-period Linear Regression** line (sometimes called LR30). This can provide a sense of the trend or mean price on the 60m chart. It’s a lesser-used indicator in many strategies, but Shapiro’s chart includes it as another reference for trend and potential reversion zones. (Some traders may skip this, but it’s part of the official PS60 setup).

* **Chart Platform & Appearance:** The PS60 chart can be set up on various platforms. Thinkorswim (TOS), TradingView, eSignal, and TC2000 have all been used by PS60 traders. Access A Trader provides specific walkthroughs for setting up each platform’s chart with the correct MAs and colors. Choose a platform you are comfortable with that allows multi-timeframe viewing (you’ll want daily and 60min). Use a **dark background** if preferred and color the moving averages distinctively (for example: 5 EMA white, 20 EMA yellow, 50 SMA red, 200 SMA blue – any scheme that you internalize). The goal is that at a quick glance you can see **where the next lines of support/resistance are** on your 60-min chart.

* **Clean Layout:** Your 60-min chart, once set up, will inevitably have many lines due to the numerous averages. It’s okay – each line has a purpose (each could halt a move). That said, avoid adding *too many other indicators*. Volume bars are fine (volume spikes can confirm pivot break strength), but oscillators like RSI/MACD are generally not part of the core PS60 method. Keep the focus on price and these key technical levels. One approach (as per community members) is to use **translucent “clouds”** for pairs of MAs to reduce clutter (e.g. shade area between 5 and 10 EMA as one color cloud). The exact visual style is personal preference – the essential part is having the correct levels drawn.

* **Pre-Market Data:** Determine how your chart handles pre-market. Dan often uses pre-market highs/lows for opening range reference when relevant. Some traders include the 9:00–9:30am pre-market in the first “hour” candle so that the 10am pivot considers pre-market action; others prefer using only regular hours. The cheat sheet notes *“take the high of the stock from 9am-10am (counting premarket\!) and after 10am, that high becomes your new pivot”* if the stock gapped over the prior day’s level. Thus, it’s important to be aware of pre-market highs/lows, especially for gap plays (more on this later). Configure your chart to either display pre-market faintly or just know how to quickly check it.

**Preferred Platforms:** There is no single required platform, but **ThinkOrSwim (TOS)** is popular (AAT provides a shared workspace), as is **TradingView** for its ease of use. The official Access A Trader course includes chart setup files for TOS, TradingView, eSignal, and TC2000. The process can be replicated on any charting software that allows multiple MAs and custom indicators. For color coding, a common scheme might be: 5 EMA \= white, 10 EMA \= cyan, 20 EMA \= yellow, 50 SMA \= red, 200 SMA \= blue (just as an example). Use dashed lines for some and solid for others if it helps differentiate.

Once your 60-minute chart is configured with these elements, **save the workspace**. You will be using this chart constantly during market hours. Shapiro’s method also involves looking at the **daily chart** of the same stock for bigger picture levels – so having a dual-chart view (daily and 60m) or the ability to toggle quickly is useful.

In summary, the PS60 chart setup creates a visual map of **all potential support and resistance zones** on the 60-minute timeframe. With this map in hand, you’ll know exactly where the key pivot is (the last 60m candle’s high/low) and what “traffic” (moving averages or bands) lies ahead of a potential trade. As one follower noted, the theory “relies on each moving average/Bolly band acting as supply and demand on that time frame” – so setting them up accurately is critical. Now, with the technical map ready, let’s move to the execution playbook: how to trade longs and shorts using these pivots.

## **Playbook: Long & Short Setups**

The PS60 playbook covers a few core scenarios: a **morning breakout** (or breakdown) after the first hour, an **intra-day continuation** move (using a later pivot), and how to handle **gaps or failed initial moves**. In all cases, the trade logic is similar – identify the pivot, wait for the next candle to **confirm (break)** it, then execute with proper risk management. Below we break down the playbook for **longs** and **shorts** with specific steps.

### **Market-Open Breakout (Long)**

*Setup:* A stock of interest has a bullish bias (from daily chart or news) and you want to go long. Rather than jumping in at 9:30, PS60 dictates to **wait for the first 60-min candle to complete** (i.e., until 10:30am ET). The **high of that first hour candle** will be your initial pivot level for a potential long.

**Steps for Long at Open (10am Pivot Break):** (Assume market open 9:30am; times in ET)

1. **Observe 9:30–10:30 Candle:** No trades in the opening hour. Let the first hourly candle form. Note its **high** price. For example, if the stock opened around $118 and by 10:30 had hit a high of $119.50 and closed slightly below that, then $119.50 is the pivot (potential breakout level). Also observe the context: Did the stock gap up or down at the open? High volume? (If the stock opened above yesterday’s levels, yesterday’s pivot is invalid – we’ll use the opening range as new pivot, see Gap Plays below.)

2. **Set Alert at Pivot:** The moment 10:30 arrives, the second hour candle begins (10:30–11:30). As soon as that new candle **trades above the previous high ($119.50)**, the long trade is triggered – *go long* (buy) as price crosses above the pivot. The cheat sheet puts it simply: “At 10:00 AM (i.e. when next candle starts) and \[if it\] moves past previous candle’s high – **Go Long**”. Realistically, one might enter a couple cents above the pivot to ensure it’s breaking. You can use a **buy stop order** slightly above $119.50 to automate this entry.

3. **Initial Stop:** The initial stop loss is typically placed around the **pivot price** (entry price) or just below it. In this case, around $119.50 (break-even). The reasoning: if the breakout is real, price should not dip back below the pivot for long. Shapiro often uses a **mental stop at entry** once partial profit is taken, but initially you might allow a tiny wiggle (some use a few cents below pivot or the low of the breakout candle if that’s close). Essentially, risk is extremely tight – you will **not** give it more than the minimal amount, because a failure to hold the pivot early is a red flag.

4. **Take First Profit Quickly:** The PS60 method is about **cash flow**. The moment the stock gives a decent push above your entry, sell a portion (half, or one-third) of your position to lock in profit. “Whatever the first initial move is – 25c, 50c, 75c – sell half or 1/3 into it”. This secures some profit and reduces your position risk. In our example, if entry was $119.50 and within 5-10 minutes the stock pops to $120.25, you might sell half there (+$0.75 on half).

5. **Manage Stop:** As soon as that first partial is off, **move your stop on the rest to break-even** (your entry price). Now the worst-case scenario on the remainder is you scratch it out. This is a crucial psychological step – it means you’re now in a “win or scratch” trade, greatly freeing you from fear.

6. **Let it Build (5-7 Min Rule):** If the stock, upon breaking the pivot, stalls right at that level or pulls back immediately, be cautious. Dan’s rule: *“Once you go long, start your clock: if the stock got stuck at the pivot or goes down immediately, it indicates a large seller. Wait 5–7 minutes to see if they clear. If the stock does not go higher in that time, sell it – take a loss or scratch (cost of doing business). You will never win a battle with a motivated seller.”*. In practice, this means if our stock broke $119.5 and then just sat at $119.6…119.4…119.5 for several minutes without moving up, you should exit the trade (flat or small loss) rather than hope. A truly strong pivot break *should* move promptly because others are caught wrong-footed. High-beta stocks especially will usually tell you within minutes if the trade is working.

7. **Secondary Targets:** If the trade *does* continue upward after your first sell, you have a runner position left (half or two-thirds of original). The next exit point is usually at the **next supply zone**. Look at your chart: perhaps there’s a 50 SMA at $121.00, which could be resistance. You might sell another portion as it approaches $121. Or use a round number policy (many PS60 traders sell another piece at \+$1 from entry, etc.). The cheat sheet suggests: if you sold ½ initially, sell the remaining ½ at the next move; if you sold 1/3, then sell another 1/3 on the next leg up. This is discretionary but guided by technical levels.

8. **Ride the Runner / Trail Out:** If you still have a last piece (e.g. one-third position) after two scale-outs, this is your **“home run” runner**. Ideally, you let this run until you see a clear reversal signal or end-of-day, etc. However, your stop on this piece should now be at breakeven (if not already). In fact, typically once you’ve taken two profits, you might even trail the stop *above* breakeven (like behind 15-minute bars, or a moving average). The rationale: protect the bulk of gains but give a chance for trend continuation. Often these runners can turn into huge wins on trending days. But if it comes back to your entry, you’re out. *“The entire purpose is to be at break even as much as possible…if your runner gets stopped out, it was never going to keep going within the defined risk parameters”*.

**Summary of Long @ Open:** Wait for first hour’s range, buy the break of the first hour high, sell some into strength, stop to breakeven, then manage remaining. This simple routine capitalizes on the common phenomenon of an **opening range breakout** around 10:30am that often leads to a trend move. It’s essentially a specific application of ORB with the twist that you’re using the 60-min candle to define it, not 5-min or 15-min (which are more whipsaw-prone). The cheat sheet example (for longs) and the community write-ups reinforce these exact steps. Below, in the examples section, we’ll see a real chart illustrating such a trade.

### **Intra-day Continuation (Long)**

Not all trades happen right at 10:30. If the first hour doesn’t produce a breakout (or if you missed it), there are often **secondary setups** later in the day. The most common is a **continuation pivot** around mid-day or early afternoon, using the high of the *previous hour* as the trigger. This is essentially the same concept but shifted in time: “Wait for two hourly candles. Observe high of the second (previous) candle. At the top of the hour, when a new candle starts and moves past the previous candle’s high – go long”.

**Example Scenario:** The stock didn’t break out first thing, but it’s basing or grinding up slowly. Say by 11:30am, it has put in two candles and the 10:30–11:30 candle made a high at $52.00. Now at 11:30, a new candle (11:30–12:30) starts – if/when it **takes out $52.00**, that’s a long entry.

**Steps for Intra-day Pivot Long:**

1. **Identify the Setup:** Often, this occurs when the stock **consolidated** after an initial move. Maybe it tried at 10:30 but didn’t go far, or just formed an inside candle. The key is you have a clear **hourly high** from the *last completed hour*. If you’re looking at the chart at, say, noon, find the high of the 11–12 candle (or whichever just closed). That’s your new pivot.

2. **Enter on Confirmation:** As with the morning trade, you buy when price **exceeds that prior 60m high**. This might be at 11:30, or 12:30, etc., depending on when it triggers. Sometimes multiple hours go by and the high of the *second* hour is still the pivot we care about. The cheat sheet explicitly describes this: “Wait for two hourly candles… at top of the hour, when new candle starts and moves past previous candle’s high – **Go Long**”. Implementation: set an alert or buy-stop at that pivot price.

3. **Same Profit-taking Rules:** Once triggered, treat it like the prior scenario. Take a quick partial profit on the first thrust beyond the pivot. Often mid-day breakouts can be slower, so you might give it a bit more time, but the principles remain. Sell ½ or 1/3 on a decent move (could be smaller in absolute terms due to lower volatility mid-day).

4. **Stop to Breakeven:** Immediately reduce risk by moving stop up. The initial stop for an intraday pivot can also be the pivot itself. If it breaks $52 and you buy, and then it falls back under $52, you’d exit. Sometimes traders use a **15-minute candle low** as stop for midday trades (since volatility is lower, you can afford a slightly wider stop like the low of the breakout quarter-hour). But if momentum is suspect, the 5–7 min rule still applies – you don’t want a breakout that doesn’t follow through by, say, 15 minutes later.

5. **Monitor the Context:** Intra-day breakouts have to contend with more existing intraday levels. For example, if the stock spiked at open then went sideways, that morning spike high might still be the ultimate resistance to clear. Ensure that your pivot isn’t *just* breaking one hourly candle high only to smack into the morning high or a falling moving average on the next hour. Ideally, an intra-day setup is also at a **relative high for the day** (or for recent hours) so there’s fuel above.

6. **Scale and Trail:** If the trade works, you scale out as usual. Perhaps it breaks $52, you sell some at $52.50, etc. Then hold some into end-of-day or a larger move if it keeps grinding up. Many PS60 traders will exit runners by the last hour or into any end-of-day spike, since this is a day trading approach (flat by close is common, unless it turned into a swing due to extraordinary news).

**Alternate “Power Hour” Pivot:** A special case of intra-day continuation is a **late-day pivot (Power Hour)**. If no trades set up earlier, the 2:30pm or 3:30pm candle break can be a play, especially if the stock has been trending up all day and forms a late-day consolidation. The same logic – break of the last hour’s high in the final hour. Just be mindful of time (less time to run).

The **common thread**: regardless of hour, the tactic is uniform – **identify previous 60m candle’s high, buy next candle’s break**. It could be 10:30, 11:30, 1:30, etc. The PS60 method provides ample patience: if a stock isn’t ready by one hour, maybe it sets up the next. There’s no chasing needed between pivots – you simply wait for the clock to tick and either the level breaks or it doesn’t.

### **Market-Open Breakdown (Short)**

Now let’s cover the short side. The PS60 Process is symmetric: for shorts, you do the mirror image using the **low of the candles** as pivots. Short setups often occur on weak stocks or in a market downtrend, where you expect breakdowns. The simplest is the **opening range breakdown** after the first hour.

**Steps for Short at Open (10am Pivot Break to Downside):**

1. **First Hour Candle:** Just like the long, you wait out the 9:30–10:30am candle. Note the **low of that candle**. That low is your short pivot. For example, stock XYZ opens around $100, drops to $98 by 10:30, then bounces slightly and closes first hour at $98.5. The **low $98.00** is the pivot support level that, if broken, signals a short.

2. **Enter on Breakdown:** When the 10:30am candle (second hour) starts, if/when price **falls below $98.00**, you enter a short (sell/short sell the stock). It’s prudent to give maybe a couple cents below the low to avoid a false break. Use a sell-stop order under $98 if needed.

3. **Initial Stop:** Place a stop just above the pivot (entry). Essentially if it pops back above $98 after breakdown, abort the trade. Some may use the high of the breakdown candle on a short (if that’s near pivot). But usually, if momentum is genuine, it shouldn’t come back above the pivot price. So treat $98 as your line in sand for stop (plus a small cushion). Again, risk is tightly controlled.

4. **First Cover (Partial Profit):** Cover (buy back) half or one-third of your short position at the first flush down. For example, if it breaks $98 and quickly drops to $97.25, you might cover some around $97.25 (a \~$0.75 gain on that portion). Short moves can happen fast, so be ready to take that quick gain. The cheat sheet mirrors the long rules: “Cover ½ or 1/3 at first move (25c/50c/etc)”.

5. **Move Stop to Breakeven:** After banking some profit, move your stop on the remainder to your entry price ($98). This means if the stock reverses back up to $98, you’ll cover and break even on the rest. At this stage, you’ve locked in some profit and guaranteed no loss on the final portion – a comfortable position to be in.

6. **5-Minute Rule for Shorts:** Just like the longs, if the breakdown doesn’t follow through immediately, be cautious. *“Once you go Short, start your clock: if stock got stuck at the previous low or goes up immediately, likely a big buyer is present. Wait 5-7 minutes… if no lower low, cover the short (scratch or small loss). You won’t win against a motivated buyer.”*. High-volume down breaks usually keep dropping; if they don’t, something’s off (buyer absorbing). So, if our example falls to $97.90 then stalls and starts inching up for 5+ minutes, best to cover near entry and exit.

7. **Secondary Covers:** If the trade continues downward, cover more at the next **demand zone**. For instance, maybe there’s a 200 EMA at $96 that could act as support – you might take another partial off as it approaches $96. Or simply at another round-number increment (say cover another piece at $96.50). As the cheat sheet says: if covered ½ initially, cover rest at next move (or at breakeven if bounce); if covered 1/3, then cover another 1/3 on next leg and let last run or cover at breakeven stop.

8. **Final Piece:** The last portion can run for a home run if the stock really tanks. Continue to trail your stop (maybe above each new 15-min candle’s high, or a technical level like a moving average trailing above). Eventually, you’ll either get stopped out at breakeven or higher (locking in what’s left) or you close it into the close of day. Shorts often require more vigilance since intraday bounces can be sharp – but by this point you should have profit locked and an emotionless plan.

**Important:** Short selling has its own risks (borrow availability, rapid short-covering rallies). Ensure you have the ability to short the stock (in margin account, shares available to borrow). PS60’s methodology treats shorts very similarly to longs, but be mentally prepared for faster moves.

The first-hour breakdown trade is a go-to in weak markets or on stocks with bad news. It’s essentially the flip of ORB: an Opening Range **Breakdown**. The method helps avoid shorting too early (e.g. shorting in first 30 min can be perilous due to volatility). By waiting for that hourly low to confirm, you get validation that sellers remain in control after the initial volatility.

### **Gap Plays & Variations**

Sometimes a stock will **gap up or down** significantly at the open due to news or earnings. This can complicate the standard pivot plan because the stock might open *above* or *below* the prior day’s pivot levels, or even above the first hour’s range. Dan Shapiro’s process has specific guidance for these cases:

* **If Stock Gaps Above Previous Day’s Pivot:** Suppose your stock closed at $50 and had a pivot at $50.50 for a breakout, but next morning it opens at $52 (due to gap up). In such a case, the prior pivot ($50.50) is no longer useful (stock already above it). What to do? PS60 says: use the **Opening Range High** as the new pivot. In other words, *“You now can trade it ‘Opening Range Highs’ – take the high from 9am-10am (counting premarket) and after 10am, whatever that high was becomes your new pivot”*. So, treat the first hour high as the trigger (just like a normal day). Essentially, ignore yesterday’s levels and focus on today’s first hour. This aligns with the earlier sections – just reinforcing that when a gap invalidates yesterday’s setup, revert to OR breakout strategy with first hour’s range.

* **If Stock Gaps Below Previous Day’s Pivot:** Same logic for shorts. If a stock was setting up for a short under a certain level yesterday but gaps down way below it, you wouldn’t chase at the open. Instead, use the first hour’s low as the pivot to short if it breaks later. This often becomes an **Opening Range breakdown** play.

* **Gap Fill Reversal Variation:** Sometimes a stock gaps up big, then during the first hour sells off, filling the gap or partially. In these cases, the high of the first hour might actually be the opening print and the stock goes down from there. A PS60 trader might note that initial high but wouldn’t go long unless it comes back up to break it later in the day (which could be a **fade then rip** scenario). Alternatively, if the bias is short, one could play a breakdown if the stock takes out the first hour low (gap-fill breakdown continuation).

* **Failed Follow-Through (Reload Seller/Buyer):** This isn’t a separate “play” per se, but a scenario to manage. If a pivot triggers but fails (the 5-7 minute stall scenario), consider an alternate tactic: sometimes, after stopping out, you might **re-enter** if the stock later takes out that level decisively (after the seller is cleared). For example, you went long at $119.5, it stalled, you exited. If 20 minutes later it **finally** pushes through $119.5 with volume, that could actually be the real break now that the seller’s done. Dan often says a reload seller might hold a level for a bit, but once gone, the level is free. So a savvy trader can attempt the trade again on a second attempt of the pivot – with same rules.

* **Low Volume / Slow Stocks:** The 5-7 minute rule is mainly for high-beta, fast moving names. If you’re trading a slower stock (say a utility stock that barely moves), you might allow more time than 5-7 minutes for a pivot to work, or use a 15-minute stop (the low of the quarter-hour as stop). The concept is similar but adjusted for pace. The **15-minute candle stop** method mentioned in the in-depth notes basically says: for many trades, *“the low/high of the current 15 minute candle you entered on”* can serve as a logical stop level. Because if the trade is good, it shouldn’t violate that intra-hour mini support/resistance either. This often gives a bit more room than a straight breakeven stop and is useful if a stock is whippy.

* **Bounce Plays (Counter-trend at Bollinger Bands):** An advanced variation in PS60 is using the hourly Bollinger Bands for **reversal trades** – e.g. buying a stock at the **bottom of its 60m Bollinger Band** for a bounce, or shorting at the top band for a fade. These are counter-trend “pivot” trades: instead of taking a breakout, you’re taking a reversal at an extreme. Dan notes this is “more acute and takes more deft to execute,” with different risk management (you can’t use the 5-min rule as easily). Essentially, you treat the touch of the band as a potential pivot and use the high/low of that candle as your stop. For example, stock dumps to 60m lower band – you **buy** that candle’s close, stop under its low, hoping for a mean-reversion bounce. While part of the PS60 arsenal, these are less frequent and not advisable for novices. Always consider overall context (e.g. if S\&P is in freefall, trying to catch a bounce at a band is risky).

* **Prior Day High/Low pivots:** Sometimes the pivot level of interest comes from the *previous day’s range*. For instance, a stock that closed strong might have a known resistance at yesterday’s high. If today it consolidates and then takes out *that* level, it’s also a viable pivot (even if intra-day 60m structure is messy). Dan’s nightly watchlist often identifies such levels (e.g. “ABC \> 114.57” as a pivot for next day). If a stock opens above that level, we treat it like a gap (use OR). If it opens below, then taking it out intraday is a trade. The Tumblr letter example given: stock closed with HOD 114.57, that becomes next day’s pivot; if the stock opens below 114.57, that level remains valid; if it opens above 114.57, pivot is void and we go to OR pivot (115.30 in their example after first hour). So always be aware of **yesterday’s key levels** as they can align with today’s intraday pivots.

In summary, gap and variation rules ensure that the PS60 Process adapts to different opening conditions but stays consistent in spirit: use meaningful price levels as your trigger. Whether it’s yesterday’s high or today’s first hour high, a line is drawn and you act only when it’s crossed (and confirm there’s room to run). If a move fails, either step aside or sometimes re-attack on a later attempt when the obstacle’s gone.

The “special situations” like Bollinger bounce are advanced plays and should be approached with caution, but they underscore that once you master basic pivot trades, you can expand to more nuanced uses of the same concept (pivot \= any significant level where a stock could reverse or accelerate). The bread-and-butter remains the straightforward breakouts and breakdowns described in the playbook above.

## **Risk-Management Rules**

Risk management is **the cornerstone** of the PS60 Process – Shapiro often emphasizes that *no trading strategy works without discipline on stops and position sizing*. Here we outline the key risk rules and guidelines:

* **Tight Initial Risk (Small Stops):** As seen, entries are taken right at the confirmation of a level, and stops are set very close (essentially at the pivot price or just beyond). This typically means risk of only a **few cents to maybe 20–30 cents** on liquid large-cap stocks. The idea is that if you’re wrong, you’re wrong quickly and minimal damage is done. For high-priced volatile stocks, a reasonable stop might be a bit wider (maybe using the 15-min candle method) – but even then, the mindset is to keep risk as tight as the trade allows. By doing so, PS60 trades often have an excellent **risk-reward ratio**, because the upside potential (to next supply/demand) is often multiple times the stop distance.

* **Position Sizing:** Start with a size such that a stop-out is tolerable. For example, if your stop is $0.30 and you risk $300 per trade, you could take 1000 shares. Many traders using PS60 scale their size depending on the stock’s volatility: smaller size on higher beta names (because each move is bigger). One nice aspect of PS60 is you often trade the *same names repeatedly* (popular momentum stocks), so you get a feel for how much size you can handle on, say, TSLA vs AAPL. The nightly watchlist from AAT might include large caps like $AAPL, $TSLA, $NFLX, etc., which are relatively liquid to handle decent size.

* **Partial Profits & Cash Flow:** The method explicitly calls for taking profits **incrementally**. This not only locks in gains but also *reduces the risk of the remaining position*. For instance, if you sell half at \+0.50, you’ve essentially covered the cost of the stop on the rest (in many cases). Locking profits helps combat greed and secures a base hit. Dan’s philosophy is that trading is about consistent **cash flow** first, home runs second. By always paying yourself on the first move, you ensure you have something to show even if the rest of the trade scratches out. This also prevents the psychological pain of turning a winner into a loser.

* **Move Stop to Breakeven ASAP:** After the first partial sale, the **stop on the remainder goes to breakeven** (entry price). This is repeated throughout PS60 documentation. The logic: once some profit is banked, there’s no reason to let the rest lose money. Worst-case, you exit the rest flat and still have the partial gain. Best-case, it runs further. This essentially **eliminates risk** from the trade after an initial favorable move, allowing a stress-free hold. Traders must be disciplined to actually honor this – it’s tempting to loosen stops to “give it room,” but that’s against PS60 rules unless there’s a specific technical reason.

* **5–7 Minute Timer (High Beta Stocks):** This rule is a signature risk control for avoiding *hope*. If trading a fast mover (high beta), give it at most \~5 minutes (some say up to 7 minutes) to start moving in your favor. If it doesn’t, **exit immediately**. Over a large sample, it’s observed that legitimate momentum breakouts rarely languish; if they do, probability of failure rises. Cutting the trade quickly keeps the loss small (often near flat). For slower stocks, as mentioned, you might allow a bit more time (10-15 minutes) but you should have a time-based uncle point. This timer prevents you from getting stuck in a trade that’s not behaving as expected, freeing you to redeploy capital elsewhere.

* **Discipline on Stops – No Excuses:** *“Any failure to abide by stops will mean total failure of all preparation”* – a stern warning from the detailed PS60 notes. The system assumes you WILL take your stop when it hits. Do **not average down**, do not widen it on the fly, do not “hope it comes back.” If a pivot trade fails, accept it and move on. The documentation even goes into the psychology: taking a loss is admitting you were wrong, which is hard, but necessary. A trader must internalize that a stopped-out trade is not a personal failure; it’s a normal cost of doing business. The key is to *keep those costs small*. “If you cannot admit you are wrong, trading will make you pay for it monetarily and psychologically” – a powerful statement. Thus, make stop discipline your religion.

* **No Chasing – Wait for Confirmation:** Another risk aspect is avoiding **FOMO trades**. The PS60 approach inherently prevents chasing because you always wait for the candle and pivot. But in the heat of the moment, if you see a stock ripping *before* hitting your level, you might feel the urge to jump in. **Resist that.** If it moves without you, so be it – there will be others. Chasing a move that hasn’t confirmed often results in buying right into resistance and then getting caught. The notes emphasize *never to chase a candle just because it’s moving*; it induces stress and often losses. It’s better to miss a trade than to break your process. Remember, part of risk management is **not entering low probability situations** in the first place.

* **Use of 15-min Candle Stop:** For risk management nuance, some traders use the low of the 15-minute candle in which they entered as the stop (especially if not yet in profit). Why? Because if a breakout is real, a strong 60m pivot break typically won’t even break its 15-min candle structure. If it does, something’s off. Using a 15-min stop can occasionally save you from a larger loss if breakeven is too tight or not yet reached. However, one must use judgment – e.g., if you entered at end of a 15-min candle that was huge, that stop might be too wide to make sense. Common sense overrides any hard rule in extreme cases.

* **Risk/Reward Assessment (“Is the trade worth it?”):** Before taking any pivot trade, ask “Is the trade worth it?” as the community write-up suggests. This means ensure that the distance from pivot to the next major technical level offers a decent reward relative to your risk. For example, if pivot is $115.30 and next supply is $115.42 (12 cents higher), that trade is **not worth it**. You’d skip because even if it works, the payoff is tiny. Always evaluate if there’s at least, say, 2:1 or 3:1 reward/risk to the next obstacle. This planning is risk management at the trade selection level – avoiding subpar trades prevents unnecessary losses or frustrations.

* **Max Daily Loss / Trade Limits:** While not explicitly in the provided text, any sound plan should include a daily stop for oneself (e.g., if you hit X amount of loss in a day, stop trading) and maybe a limit on trades per day. The PS60 process often yields only a few prime setups daily. It’s wise to focus on the best and not overtrade. Shapiro’s community likely advocates quality over quantity – your job is not to take 20 trades a day, but the 1-3 that really align with criteria. This indirectly limits risk (fewer trades, fewer fees, less exposure).

In essence, **risk management in PS60 can be summarized**: Keep losses small and infrequent, let winners run in a controlled way. By front-loading the discipline (small stops, quick partial outs, breakeven remainder), you put yourself in a position where even a 50% win rate can be highly profitable, because winners by design will often be larger than losers. And if your win rate is higher (which often, with such selective criteria, it can be), you’ll do very well – as long as you don’t violate the rules on those trades that don’t work.

Shapiro’s own trading career survived wild markets precisely by cutting losers and protecting capital. So for anyone adopting PS60, the motto should be: *Follow the process, especially the stops*. A trader in the community quipped that failing to follow your stop is like crashing a fast car – one lapse can be devastating.

We’ll now see how these rules come together in real examples.

## **Annotated Trade Examples**

Let’s walk through several example trades using the PS60 Process, complete with annotated 60-minute charts. These will illustrate how the strategy is executed in real market scenarios, including entry, profit-taking, and stop placement. (All examples use hypothetical yet realistic data for demonstration.)

### **Example Trade 1: Morning Breakout Long**

**Scenario:** Stock *ABC* opened around $118 and had positive news. We wait until 10:30am to get the first hourly candle. The first candle’s high was **$119.50**. We anticipate a long trade if $119.50 is broken in the next hour, as long as there’s room to the next resistance (say the next supply is around $121+ from a 50MA). Chart below shows the 60-min candles.

*Example 1: After the first hour sets pivot $119.50 (blue line), the next candle breaks out. Entry at pivot break, partial profit taken as price surges to \~$121, and final exit when price comes back to entry.*

* **10:30am (New Candle starts):** As soon as 10:30 hits, a new 60m candle begins. *ABC* pushes above $119.50 around 10:35. We **go long at \~$119.50** (entry arrow in chart). There was little pre-market resistance and plenty of “air” to the next target (\~$121), so conditions favor a breakout.

* **Initial stop:** set at $119.50 (entry price). Essentially at breakeven; we’re ready to scratch if it falters. (One could also use just under $119.50 to allow a few cents noise.)

* **Quick push and Partial:** The break is successful; within 15 minutes, ABC hits \~$120.75–$121.00. We sell **half** our shares around $121.0 (gray ‘Partial’ arrow). This is \~+$1.50 gain on half the position. We booked cash flow.

* **Stop moves to breakeven:** Now the stop on the remaining half is placed at $119.50 (our entry). This locks that if the stock reverses, we won’t lose on the rest.

* **Running and Monitoring:** The stock actually went as high as $121.5 in the second hour before slowing. We didn’t perfectly top-tick the partial, but that’s fine. The third hour candle (11:30–12:30) was a bit red (some profit-taking, as shown). It still closed around $120.

* **5-minute rule note:** In this case, not needed – the stock moved immediately in our favor (no stall). If it had hung at $119.5-119.6 for 5+ minutes, we’d have exited. It didn’t.

* **Exit remainder:** By early afternoon, the stock drifted back down to test the pivot $119.50 from above. Our stop at breakeven was hit around 1:30pm, so we **exit the rest at $119.50** (orange ‘Exit’ arrow). This last portion ends up a scratch trade, but that’s fine because the first half was a solid win.

* **P\&L:** We gained \~$1.50 on half the position, $0 on the other half. Net effect: \+0.75 average per share (assuming equal halves). If we had 1000 shares, that’s \+$750 on the trade. Not a home run, but a good **base hit** day trade with minimal risk taken.

This example shows the classic OR breakout. Notice after entry the stock did not look back for 5-10 minutes, which signaled it was good. When it finally did come back, we were already secure. Importantly, imagine if $119.50 broke and we *didn’t* take profit at $121 and move stop – the stock coming back to $119.50 would’ve erased the win or even made it a loser. By following PS60 method, we locked gains and avoided that pain.

### **Example Trade 2: Midday Continuation Long**

**Scenario:** Stock *DEF* didn’t do much in the morning – maybe a small range. By 11:30am, it had formed two hourly candles, with the **high of the 10:30–11:30 candle at $52.00**. The stock is uptrending slowly, so we plan a long if it breaks $52.00 after 11:30.

*Example 2: Intra-day pivot break. After a quiet morning, the 11:30–12:30 candle breaks above the previous hour’s $52 pivot. Entry long at $52, partial out around $53, final piece stopped at breakeven ($52) when momentum faded.*

* **Setup:** First hour (9:30–10:30) was choppy around $50–51 (not trade-worthy). Second hour (10:30–11:30) stock moved up and hit $52.00 high. We mark that level (blue line in chart).

* **12:30pm:** A new candle starts. Around 12:45pm, *DEF* trades **above $52.00** – our trigger. We enter long just over $52 (black 'Entry' arrow).

* **Context check:** No immediate MA resistance overhead; next known supply maybe at $54 (yesterday’s high or upper band). So reward/risk looks good.

* **Partial profit:** The breakout is gradual but steady. By 1:15pm, price reaches \~$53.00. We sell **one-third** of position at \~$53 (grey 'Partial' arrow). We choose 1/3 here anticipating maybe a longer grind, but either 1/2 or 1/3 is fine.

* **Stop moves to $52.00:** We now have 2/3 position left with stop at entry (52). Worst-case remaining becomes flat.

* **Continued move:** The stock actually continues to about $53.5 by 2:30pm. (We could have taken another partial at 53.5 – suppose we did sell another 1/3 at 53.5, though not marked explicitly.) It then starts faltering as overall market dips late-day.

* **Revisiting pivot:** In the final hour, *DEF* falls back toward the $52 pivot from above. Our stop at $52 is eventually hit at \~3:15pm. We exit the remainder at breakeven (orange 'Exit' arrow).

* **P\&L:** If we sold one-third at \+$1.00 and another one-third at \+$1.50, that’s roughly \+$1.25 average on 2/3 of the shares, and 0 on last 1/3. Net average gain per share \~+$0.83. For 900 shares (if that was our lot), that’s about \+$750 net. Again a nice winner with minimal heat.

This demonstrates a **midday continuation** play. Note it was slower; we gave it a bit more time to reach targets, but still adhered to core rules (partial, stop to b/e). The 5-7 minute rule is less strict on a slow grind like this, but we did expect *some* movement fairly soon, which we got. If it had sat at 52 until 1pm with no progress, we might have exited (time stop) and perhaps re-entered later if it tried again.

### **Example Trade 3: Morning Breakdown Short**

**Scenario:** Stock *XYZ* had bad news overnight and gapped down at the open. It opened around $100, dropped in the first hour to a low of **$98.00**, then bounced slightly to close the hour around $98.50. The market is weak, so we plan a short if it breaks below $98.00 after 10:30.

*Example 3: Opening range breakdown short. The first hour low $98 (blue line) is the pivot. The next candle breaks below – entry short \~$98. Stock falls to \~$96.5 – cover partial. Then it bounces back to $98 pivot, triggering stop on rest (exit at breakeven). Trade nets a profit on the partial.*

* **10:30am:** As second hour starts, *XYZ* quickly drops below the **$98.00 pivot** around 10:40am. We **short sell at \~$98.00** (black 'Entry' arrow at candle 1-\>2). There was no major support immediately below – good.

* **Initial stop:** set just above $98 (couple ticks). If it popped back above 98, we’d bail.

* **Fast drop and Partial cover:** Sellers pile on; the stock slides to about $96.50 by 11:00am. We buy-to-cover **half** of our short at \~$96.5 (grey 'Partial' arrow) to lock in \+$1.50 gain.

* **Stop to breakeven:** Remaining half stop now at $98.00. So if it goes back up, we exit flat on rest.

* **Midday bounce:** Indeed, after hitting \~$96.5, the stock finds some support (perhaps a moving average or just intraday buyers) and starts to bounce. By noon, it drifts back near $98.

* **Stop hits:** It touches $98 around 12:30 and our stop triggers. We cover the remaining half at $98.0 (orange 'Exit' arrow) for breakeven on that portion.

* **P\&L:** On half the position we made $1.50, on half $0, so net \+$0.75 per share. Similar to previous cases, a solid win relative to risk (we risked maybe $0.10 to make $1.50 on that first half).

* **Notes:** The 5-minute rule wasn’t needed here as it flushed immediately. If it had broken $98 and hung at $97.8 for 5+ minutes, we’d have covered early. We also note that after stopping us out at breakeven, the stock did continue higher (perhaps a lasting bottom for the day around $96.5). That’s fine – once it returned to pivot, our short thesis was over for now. If we still believed in more downside, we could watch for another pivot later (e.g., if it failed to break above a certain bounce high and then rolled over, etc.), but that would be a separate trade.

This example showcases how a textbook short is handled. The risk management saved us from a winning trade turning into a loss – had we not moved stop down, that bounce to 98 could’ve wiped out gains or gone higher. Instead, we guaranteed a profit. Also, we took advantage of the morning momentum which is often strongest for breakdowns on bad news.

**General Observations Across Examples:** In all cases, once the trade moved, **partial profit was taken** and **stop was adjusted to breakeven**, securing a no-lose situation on the remainder. This is the hallmark of PS60 execution. None of the trades show letting a winner turn into a big loser. Either we got stopped at breakeven (worst case after partial) or we voluntarily exited when the trade wasn’t acting right (5-min rule, etc.).

Also notice the timing of entries: right after the hour marks (10:30 or later). There were no entries at 10:15 or 10:20, etc. – discipline to wait for the candle to end and confirm saved us from false moves.

Each example had a **defined pivot level** from a prior candle and an entry precisely at that level. This mechanical trigger helps remove second-guessing.

Finally, these trades illustrate the **psychology**: by taking profit and moving stop, trading becomes less stressful. You can’t be hurt badly, so you can let the trade play out or stop out without worry. This enables executing the next trade with a clear head. It’s this rinse-and-repeat consistency that the PS60 Process aims for – *“make money on 1 trade, congratulate yourself… then find the next”*.

## **Glossary & Cheat Sheets**

**PS60** – *Pivot Strategy on 60-Minute chart*. The name of Dan Shapiro’s process. Sometimes just referred to as “the process” or “60-minute pivots.”

**Pivot (Level):** A key price level that acts as a trigger for a trade. Typically the high or low of a 60-minute candle that, when exceeded by the next candle, indicates a potential breakout or breakdown. Also used more generally for any significant level (e.g. “the pivot is 114.57” could mean that’s the price to watch for a move, perhaps from a prior day high).

**Confirm / Confirmation:** The act of the next candle trading through a pivot level, thus validating it. “Confirming a pivot” means e.g. an 11:30 bar going above the 10:30 bar’s high. Without confirmation, no trade. Sometimes said as “stock **built** over the level” or “took out the level.”

**Supply & Demand:** In PS60 context, *supply* \= overhead resistance (where sellers might emerge), *demand* \= underlying support (where buyers might step in). Supply zones often correspond to moving average lines above the price; demand zones to MAs below. The mantra “stocks move from supply to supply, demand to demand” encapsulates the idea of trading between these levels.

**Channels:** Slang for the ranges defined by the 60-min candles. E.g. “60-minute channel” refers to the range of a few hours that needs to break for a move. Also, Dan’s catchphrase “using 60 minute channels” means focusing on that timeframe to eliminate noise.

**Reload Seller/Buyer:** A term for a large hidden seller or buyer who keeps refilling their order at a level, thwarting the breakout/breakdown temporarily. If a stock hits pivot and can’t get through because someone keeps selling, that’s a reload seller. Usually identified by time & sales showing repeat selling at same price, or Level 2 showing size that doesn’t disappear. The 5-7 minute rule is about recognizing a possible reload seller (or buyer for shorts) and not fighting them.

**Partial / Partial Out:** Taking a partial profit. Often expressed as “sell half” or “sell 1/3” etc. The cheat sheet consistently says “sell ½ or 1/3 at first move”. Doing so is “taking a partial.”

**PS60 Cheat Sheet:** A concise list of rules (like the one reproduced from Tumblr) covering theory, chart setup, trade execution steps for long/short, cautionary notes, etc. Many traders keep this printed as a reference until it’s ingrained.

**Decision Flow Chart:** A flow chart (usually provided in AAT course) mapping the trade decision process: e.g. “Did stock confirm hourly pivot? If yes \-\> check next supply distance: enough room? If yes \-\> enter. If no \-\> skip. After entry \-\> did it move in 5 min? If no \-\> exit, if yes \-\> take partial,” etc. This helps visualize the step-by-step logic and conditional decisions. *(In the appendix or resources, we reference if available.)*

**Basic Training vs Advanced:** Dan often distinguishes between the *basic PS60* (the core strategy for intraday) and more *advanced* tactics (like options, or the Bollinger band fades, etc.). For instance, the membership levels mentioned *“Basic PS60 Training”* vs *“Advanced PS60”*. New traders should focus on the basic rules first.

**Squawk Box / Webinar:** In the community, Dan runs a live audio (Squawk Box) and webinar during market hours. He calls out pivots and market analysis. The term might come up like “on the Squawk, Dan noted a reload seller at that pivot.”

**Daily Pivot Feed:** A private Twitter feed or similar where pivot levels are posted in real-time. For example, members might see “$TSLA 60min pivots: 725, 714 support” etc. This feed helps traders know what levels Dan is watching.

**Nightly Watchlist:** A list of stocks with their key levels sent out after-hours for next day prep. E.g. “AAPL \> 150.25, AMZN \< 3300” etc. It’s derived from daily chart patterns and PS60 principles. Used in preparation phase.

**Whole Number & Half Number:** Psychological price levels like $50.00, $50.50. The detailed notes mention these have higher odds of significance – “like safe zones in tag”. Essentially, breakouts through whole numbers often attract more participation. Dan sometimes prefers pivots that coincide with such numbers, but will trade others too. Just notable that if a pivot is say $100 vs $99.87, the $100 might actually have more oomph due to being a round number psychologically.

**“Is it worth it?”:** This phrase in the notes reminds traders to ask if the trade has enough room to next resistance to justify taking it. It’s a checkpoint in the decision process (if answer is no, skip trade).

**Intraday vs Overnight Risk:** PS60 is primarily an intraday strategy – flat by end of day is common unless you have high conviction for a swing (which is separate from this process). So “overnight risk” refers to holding positions when market is closed (PS60 traders usually avoid that unless it’s planned).

**Emotional Buyer/Seller:** When a stock is extended and retail traders chase, they’re “emotional buyers.” A technical seller might fade them at known resistance. Understanding this dynamic is part of PS60 philosophy – you want to be the technical trader selling to emotional buyers at supply, not the emotional buyer.

## **Common Mistakes & Troubleshooting**

Even with a solid process, traders can stumble. Here are common mistakes in applying the PS60 Process – and how to fix or avoid them:

* **Entering Before Confirmation:** Perhaps the most common error by impatient traders. They see a stock nearing a pivot and jump in *before* the candle closes or before it actually breaks. For example, anticipating a break that doesn’t happen. This often leads to whipsaw losses. **Solution:** Strictly enforce the rule: *no confirmation, no trade*. If you find yourself bending this rule, remind yourself of the times it saved you from false moves. If a level is truly good, being a few cents late is not an issue – it will run plenty. Discipline here is key.

* **Chasing Extended Moves:** Occasionally a stock will make a big move within the hour, blowing past a pivot mid-candle. Some traders then chase mid-candle. This is dangerous because the entry is not at a defined pivot and you might be buying just as it peaks. **Solution:** If you miss the initial move, either wait for a pullback or see if it sets a new pivot (like next hour continuation). Do not FOMO buy a move that already went. The process is meant to keep you out of those emotional trades. As Dan says, *never chase a candle just because it’s moving* – it builds bad habits.

* **Ignoring the 5-Minute Rule:** Holding on to a trade that immediately isn’t working, hoping it will turn. New traders might think “maybe it just needs more time.” Meanwhile, a reload seller is capping it and the trade goes nowhere or turns down. The result: taking a full stop or larger loss, or tying up capital in a dead trade. **Solution:** Set a literal 5-minute timer after entry (especially on fast movers). If after 5-7 minutes there’s zero progress or it’s stuck, **get out**. You can reassess calmly once you’re out. More often than not, your capital is better deployed elsewhere or waiting for another setup.

* **Not Taking Any Profit (Greed):** Sometimes traders want the whole move and forego the initial partial sale. Then a trade that was up nicely reverses and hits breakeven stop – result: no gain, frustration (or worst case, they didn’t move stop and it becomes a loss). **Solution:** Follow the plan: **always** take some off on the first favorable move. It’s not about being right or maximizing every penny; it’s about consistent profits. If you struggle with this, literally set limit orders in advance for partial profit at a reasonable level (like \+0.50 from entry or at first technical target). Scaling out is your friend – it guarantees a winner if the trade was up at all.

* **Not Moving Stop (or Widening It):** The opposite of above – instead of greed, this is often *hope or fear*. A trader might get a partial, then as the stock comes back to entry they think “I don’t want to get stopped out flat, I’ll give it a little room” – and they remove or widen the stop. This can lead to turning a winning trade into a losing trade, violating the risk protocol. **Solution:** Recognize that moving stop to breakeven is a *non-negotiable rule* in this system. If you have trouble with this, remind yourself that if it truly is good, it shouldn’t hit breakeven after giving you profit. And if it does hit, you can always re-enter if it sets up again. Don’t let hope creep in – stick to the process.

* **Trading Against Major Trends:** Another mistake is taking every pivot signal in isolation without regard to bigger picture. For instance, trying a bunch of long pivots on a day when the market is tanking and all stocks are weak – you might get overwhelmed by false breakouts or very small follow-through. Or shorting pivots in a roaring bull trend too aggressively. **Solution:** Incorporate some market context. While PS60 setups can work in any market, your success rate will be higher if you **favor longs when overall market or sector is bullish**, and vice versa. If you do take counter-trend trades, perhaps be quicker to take profits. Also, if a stock’s daily chart is counter to your intraday trade (e.g. daily uptrend but you’re shorting an intraday pivot breakdown), understand you’re going against a larger tide – manage expectations and risk accordingly.

* **Overtrading / Forcing Trades:** PS60 might only yield a handful of clean setups per day. Some traders get antsy and start trading suboptimal things outside the method (like a random 5-min pattern or chasing something because they’re bored). This usually leads to losses that could erase gains. **Solution:** Stick to your prepared list of stocks and levels. Quality over quantity. If you hit your goal or a couple good trades, there’s no need to trade all day. It’s okay to sit on hands waiting for the next *proper* pivot. If you catch yourself wanting to trade something not in the plan, take a walk or review the rules.

* **Not Doing Nightly Preparation:** The process assumes you come in with a plan (which stocks to watch, what levels). If you skip scanning charts or neglect to note key levels, you may miss great setups or worse, trade something without knowing a looming resistance. **Solution:** Dedicate time each evening or morning to identify your top setups. Use the community’s nightly watchlist if available, but also do your own homework. Mark charts with those levels so you’re ready. Preparation breeds confidence and prevents random trading.

* **Mis-drawing Levels:** Occasionally, one might use the wrong reference point (e.g. using a 15-min high instead of the 60-min high by mistake). Or not noticing pre-market high which might be the true level if stock opened above yesterday’s range. **Solution:** Double-check that your pivot is indeed the correct one: last full 60min candle’s high/low unless overridden by gap logic. Mark pre-market high/low on the chart for first hour if needed (especially if significant). With experience this becomes second nature.

* **Emotional Reactions / Revenge Trading:** Taking a loss (even a small one) can trigger frustration. A common mistake is to immediately try to make it back by jumping into something else without setup (revenge trading), or doubling size next time in anger, etc. **Solution:** Adhere to the system’s built-in safeguards. Losses are kept small by design; remind yourself it’s just one of many. If you follow process, a winner will come. Take deep breaths after a loss, maybe step away for a few minutes. The structured nature of PS60 should actually help here – it gives you a checklist to focus on rather than stewing in emotion.

* **Letting a Winner Turn into a Loser:** This should never happen if you follow the partial-and-stop rules, but if someone neglected to move their stop or took no partial, it can. It’s demoralizing and can shake confidence. **Solution:** Use that pain as motivation to *never* break the rules again. The rules are there specifically to avoid this scenario. Consider instituting a personal rule: once a trade is \+X in your favor, you will not allow it to go \-X against you (some do this even if they didn’t partial for whatever reason). Basically, promise yourself to protect profits.

**Troubleshooting Tips:**

* If you find you’re repeatedly getting stopped out at breakeven on the second half (i.e., many trades where you make money on partial then rest stops out), evaluate if you’re taking profits too late or moving stop too soon. Sometimes adjusting the size of partial (e.g. take 2/3 off instead of 1/2 if trades aren’t following through much) can help lock more profit. Or consider if market conditions are choppy – in choppy times, you may decide to take full profits at closer targets rather than hold runners. The process is flexible to conditions.

* If you keep getting false breakouts (stock triggers then reverses), double check: Are you trading into nearby resistance? Is the volume confirming the break? One trick: ensure there’s a pickup in volume as pivot breaks – if volume is anemic, the move might lack conviction. You might filter trades to those with volume surges at trigger.

* If you missed a lot of trades because they happened all at once (common when market has a burst), don’t chase. Maybe use alerts or automated stop orders more to catch them next time. There’s always another setup later or tomorrow.

* If a trade doesn’t trigger by a certain time and you’re watching it all day, at some point it’s okay to call it off (e.g. if after 2pm it still hasn’t broken, maybe it won’t today). Avoid late-day impatience where you jump early because time is running out – stick to confirmation, or skip if it never confirms.

Remember, **mistakes will happen** – nobody’s perfect. The goal is to minimize them and not repeat the same ones. Journaling your trades can help identify patterns of mistakes. For instance, you might discover “I tend to jump early specifically on XYZ stock or when the market is doing ABC.” Once identified, you can consciously correct it.

Dan Shapiro’s own journey through trading disasters (dot-com bust, etc.) taught him risk management the hard way. He created PS60 to provide structure specifically so that traders wouldn’t self-sabotage. Embrace that structure. When you follow it, trading becomes almost boring – and that’s a good thing. Boring and methodical \= profitable and sustainable. When you deviate, that’s when excitement (and usually losses) come.

In short: **Trust the process** – it’s proven, as long as *you* don’t become the weakest link. If something’s not working, it’s likely a deviation or a market phase issue – go back to the rules, review these common pitfalls, and tighten up. Over time, consistent execution will replace those mistakes with sound habits.

## **Further Resources**

For those looking to deepen their understanding or stay connected with Dan Shapiro’s PS60 community, here are some valuable resources:

* **Official Access A Trader Website (AccessATrader.com):** The main site for Dan Shapiro’s trading education services. It contains information on the PS60 Process, membership options, testimonials, and a bit of background on Dan. Notably, the site often links to the free PS60 masterclass video (4-hour training) and offers what they call the “PS60 Vault” for free content.

* **Free 4-Hour PS60 Masterclass:** This is a comprehensive training video by Dan Shapiro (hosted on ps60process.com; requires sign-up). It’s essentially Dan teaching the entire PS60 method step by step, with examples. If you haven’t watched it, it’s highly recommended – many concepts in this guide are covered in Dan’s own style, and hearing/seeing him explain charts can reinforce the lessons. *(See Appendix for transcript highlights.)*

* **YouTube – Access A Trader Channel:** Dan’s YouTube channel (AccessATrader) has numerous videos. Some are daily recaps, others are specific topics:

  * *“PS60 Trading Process Explained – System to Success for Traders”* – A video that excerpts the masterclass and explains the strategy basics.

  * *“Does the PS60 Process Really Work? (Why Not Alerts?)”* – Dan discussing why he teaches a process instead of spoon-feeding alerts, reinforcing the importance of learning this method.

  * *“How I Trade PS60 with Examples”* by Yanni Nicolaides – A community member’s video explaining the strategy with his own examples, useful to see another perspective.

  * *“Swing Trading with the PS60 Process”* – Focuses on using PS60 for multi-day swings, illustrating its versatility.

  * *Daily recap videos:* e.g. “Nightly PS60 Market Analysis” – these show how Dan analyzes the day’s action and pivots that played out. Watching a few will help you internalize how to review your own trades.

* **Tumblr Write-ups (@danshep55 Tumblr):** Dan (or his students) have posted detailed write-ups on Tumblr. Two gems:

  * *“Most Detailed Breakdown \#PS60 theory”* by a student (Albert C.) – a long-form essay that we cited extensively. It’s a great read to reinforce the philosophy and nuances (psychology, prep, etc.).

  * *“PS60 Full Cheat Sheet & Trade Plan for Longs/Shorts”* – essentially the cheat sheet we quoted. Good for quick reference or sharing with trading buddies interested in the method.

* **StockTwits and Social Media:**

  * Dan’s **Twitter/X** handle is @BigDanShapiro (and/or @danshep55). He occasionally tweets insights or motivational bits. Also Access A Trader’s official account might tweet promotions or trial links.

  * **StockTwits Premium Room**: Dan had (or has) a premium room on StockTwits where members get his live commentary and alerts. The StockTwits blog did a profile on it. If you use StockTwits, following Dan or the AccessATrader room could provide a feel for how he calls out pivots in real-time (though this may overlap with paid service).

  * **Instagram**: Some coaches or communities (like Ascent Trading) reference using PS60 on their Insta posts, but the best is directly from Dan’s content.

* **Access A Trader Community/Chat:** The PS60 Trader membership includes a chatroom or forum where traders discuss setups, and a daily live webinar with Dan. Even if one doesn’t join, knowing it exists is useful – it’s a place where everyone is speaking the same “PS60 language,” which can accelerate learning. Sometimes short trial offers are available (e.g. a 30-day trial).

* **PS60 Pivot Watch (Basic Service):** If you’re not ready for full chatroom, the Pivot Watch ($47/mo as per site) gives nightly watchlists and a private Twitter feed with intraday pivot updates. This is a resource where you can see Dan’s pivot calls delivered via Twitter in real time, which can be educational to mirror against your own analysis.

* **Courses/Materials:** The training site (training.accessatrader.com) has a structured PS60 course with multiple modules (Chart setup, Preparation, Masterclass V1–V4, Q\&A recordings, etc.). It also includes downloadable **PS60 Terminology Cheat Sheet, Trade Decision Flow Chart, Risk Management Cheat Sheet**. Those PDFs condense key info – since we can’t attach them here, ensure you get those if you enroll, or refer to our Glossary which covers much of it.

* **Mentions in Trading Forums:** The PS60 Process has been discussed in various trading forums (like useThinkScript, Reddit). For example, a Reddit user citing PS60 as a strategy that “provides setups every day” with some example screenshots. While forums can be hit-or-miss, seeing others attempt to code indicators (as on useThinkScript) or share their trades can provide additional tips and variations (just be cautious and always cross-check with official methodology).

* **Books or General Reading:** While PS60 is specific, some general trading literature complements it. Dan references the importance of *screen time* and pattern recognition – books on technical analysis or trading psychology (like *Trading in the Zone*) could reinforce the mindset side. There’s no PS60 book, but Dan’s approach draws on classic principles of breakout trading, so material on swing trading breakouts might resonate.

* **Daily Routine Videos:** Sometimes Dan or others share what a typical day looks like (prep in morning, what to look for at open, midday routine, etc.). If available, those are useful to model your own routine. One principle is that after morning trades, Dan often advises to **step back during midday chop** and then possibly come back for afternoon setups if any (i.e. don’t overtrade lunchtime). Hearing that from him can help you structure your day.

* **Trial and Webinars:** Access A Trader occasionally offers free webinars or short-term trials (like “$25 for 25 days” or holiday specials). Taking a trial can give you a live look at how Dan calls out trades and interacts with members – effectively live mentorship. Plus, you might get to attend the morning strategy session or see the nightly recap process.

* **Contacting Dan / Support:** The site lists a support email (e.g. \[email protected\]) for any queries about the process or membership. If you have questions that aren’t covered by public info, reaching out might help – Dan’s team is typically responsive since they pride themselves on community and mentorship.

By leveraging these resources, you can continue to **reinforce your understanding** of the PS60 Process beyond this document. The combination of structured learning (courses/masterclass), community support (chat, streams), and personal practice (using the cheat sheets, journaling trades) creates a strong feedback loop to mastery.

**Remember:** The goal is to eventually internalize the process so you can find your own pivots and manage trades without hand-holding. As StockTwits’ blog noted, PS60 “allows you to clearly identify setups long before the trade confirms” – with time, you’ll be spotting those levels in your sleep. Until then, refer back to this guide, the transcripts, and those further resources as needed. Good luck and good trading\!

## **Appendix: Raw Transcripts & References**

*(Below we include transcripts and excerpts from key source materials used in compiling this document. These serve as reference to verify rules and provide additional context in the original speaker’s/writer’s words. Time-stamps or line references are given where applicable.)*

**1\. PS60 Process Cheat Sheet (Tumblr post by @danshep55):** This was a user-created summary of Dan Shapiro’s method, vetted by Dan. Key sections:

* *Theory:* “Stocks moves from: (a) Supply to Supply (Resistance to Resistance) \-or- (b) Demand to Demand (Support to Support). Watch a stock on a 60 Min candle chart. Each 60 Min candle needs to be confirmed by another 60 Min candle. Longs need to build over previous Highs \-or- Shorts need to build over previous Lows. Look at the 60 Min chart and observe where is the next Resistance or Support to determine what would be the ‘potential’ of the move, before entering a Trade.”

* *Chart Setup:* “Setup 60 Min Chart for PS60: 1\. Candles as Plot style, 2\. 60 Min timeframe, 3\. Add SMAs: 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 4\. Add EMAs: 4, 9, 10, 13, 20, 50, 100, 200, 5\. Add Bollinger Band (20,2), 6\. Add Linear Regression (30). Save these settings and use this 60 Min chart during trading.”

* *Executing Long at Open:* “Wait till 10:00 AM (first hourly candle). Observe High of first candle (ex: 119.50). At 10:00 AM when next candle starts and moves past previous candle’s high (119.50) \- Go Long. Sell either ½ or 1/3 at first move (whatever the initial move is, 25/50/75 cents etc.). Set stop (mental or hard) at entry price (119.50) for remaining shares. If sold ½, sell remaining ½ at next move (or sell at entry if stock moves down). If sold 1/3 initially, then sell 2/3 at next move and let last 1/3 go for either home run or stop at break even.”

* *Executing Long Intra-day:* “Wait for two hourly candles. Observe High of second (previous) candle (ex 119.50). At top of the hour, when new candle starts and moves past previous candle’s high – Go Long. (Then same partial and stop rules as above).”

* *Caution for Longs:* “Once you go Long, start your clock: (a) If the stock got stuck at High of previous candle or goes Down immediately, indicates a large or institutional seller in crowd. (b) Wait 5 to 7 minutes to clear the seller. (c) If the stock does not go higher within this time, sell the stock and take a loss or scratch trade – aka cost of doing business. (d) Keep in mind, you will never win a battle with a motivated seller aka reload seller.”

* *Executing Short at Open:* “Wait till 10:00 AM (first hour candle). Observe Low of first candle. At 10:00 AM when next candle starts and moves past previous candle’s Low – Go Short. Cover ½ or 1/3 at first move (25/50/75 cents etc.). Set stop at entry for remaining. If covered ½, cover remaining ½ at next move (or cover at entry if stock moves up). If covered 1/3, cover 2/3 at next move and let last 1/3 go for home run or stop at b/e.”

* *Executing Short Intra-day:* “Wait for two hourly candles. Observe Low of second candle. At top of hour, when new candle starts and moves past previous Low – Go Short. (Then same partial & stop rules.)”

* *Caution for Shorts:* “Once you go Short, start your clock: (a) If stock got stuck at Low of previous candle or goes Up immediately, indicates large buyer in crowd. (b) Wait 5-7 minutes to clear the buyer. (c) If stock does not go lower in this time, cover and take a loss or scratch. (d) You will never win a battle with a motivated buyer aka reload buyer.”

*(This cheat sheet covers essentially the whole strategy in brief and we can see our guide has expanded on each point.)*

**2\. Access A Trader Site – PS60 Process Section:** Highlights Dan’s description of the method.

* “The PS60 Process, developed by Dan Shapiro in 2012, is based off the theory that stocks trade from supply to supply and demand to demand. Pairing this concept with unbiased technical analysis creates a clean and uncluttered view for success. The PS60 Process’s success bases setups off of only 6 hourly candles each day as opposed to 320 one minute candles that most traders use. Stocks that confirmed the previous supply or demand have a high probability of cash flow and profits\!”

*(Used in Theory section to underscore the supply-to-supply concept and focusing on hourly candles.)*

**3\. StockTwits Blog on Premium Room (Dec 2018):** Provides a succinct explanation.

* “Our PS60 Process was designed to simplify trading by primarily focusing on the seven 60-minute candles, which allows you to clearly identify setups with defined entry and exit points long before the trade confirms. This helps you assess and mitigate risk appropriately while maximizing gains.”

*(We cited this in Executive Summary and Theory – it validates the clarity of setups and risk mitigation.)*

* “Technical analysis is the key to consistent profitability. We teach you a simple system. Our PS60 Process removes the guesswork from trading and provides you with an actionable and winning process applicable to most stocks in any market condition.”

*(Reinforces that it’s the process, not gut feeling, and it works broadly.)*

**4\. “Most Detailed Breakdown \#PS60 theory” (Tumblr, 2016, by Albert Chen):** A long essay format email. Key excerpts:

* Preparation emphasis: “Preparation for the trading day begins the day before… after market close, go through daily charts… no shortcuts… experienced trader like Dan does it every night.”

* Pattern selection: “I personally like long winding bases with a breakout or double/triple tops/bottoms – these are the only 2 patterns I look for…”

* Multi-timeframe alignment: “central theory: buying/shorting the top/bottoms of 60 minute candles. Not as simple as any stock and buying next hour’s break… parameters are myriad and specific such that only a few if any opportunities a day.”

* Chart lines: “Your Daily and 60 minute chart should have a bevy of moving averages: SMA 5,10,20,50,100,200; EMA 20,50,100,200; Linear Regression; Bollinger Bands. That is a lot of lines but each represents a spot a stock may stop… technical sellers meeting emotional buyers or vice versa is central to PS60 philosophy. In addition, the alignment of multiple time frames is central.”

* Not every stock tradeable: “Stocks we found the night before must not be rising or falling into one of these lines as that invalidates the play. Every stock trades, but not every stock is tradeable is a central tenet. After filtering for pattern and avoiding those near lines, then look at 60min timeframe… stock only has enough room to next line… meant to enhance probability.”

* Example with pivot and gap: “For example… AAPL had long base and broke out today on volume. No moving avg above, high of day was 114.57 and closed 114.30. Result: pivot next day is 114.57 and stop 114.30 (17c risk). Now, if the stock opens *below* 114.57 next day, level is valid. If it opens *above* 114.57, all work from yesterday is invalidated. The pivots are delicate… in an instant, washed away. Fear not… you now can trade it ‘Opening Range Highs’ meaning take high of stock from 9am-10am (counting premarket\!) and after 10am, whatever that high was becomes your new pivot. Hence PS60 – we want 60 minutes of data to substantiate trade. In example, stock opens 115, trades to 115.30 high by 9:59, closes 115.09 at 9:59. New pivot \=115.30, must be taken out between 10 and 11am. Beware to constantly check Bollinger and moving avg lines haven’t moved above it though, as if they have then you have supply above and trade could stop there.”

* “Hard labor of this system is delicacy of the pivot. You might come in with 5 pivots of your own, Dan gives 5, others give 5… no given any stock will reach pivot though. The work is when things slow, constantly look for names that might pivot as each chart you scan intraday might lead to a high probability trade. Easier said than done, it can be grueling and you haven’t even clicked the mouse yet, just looking for alerts.”

* Is trade worth it: “Central question: ‘Is the trade worth it?’ Majority of time pivots will have lines above/below it; question becomes is it worth doing from high of one 60min candle to next line. If pivot 115.30 and next line above is 115.42, a 12c pivot, is it really worth it? Probably not.”

* Review of rules so far: prepare nightly, avoid stocks near lines, align daily & 60, trade only confirm of next 60, vigilantly find new pivots, question if enough room.

* Don’t chase: “Above rules may seem simplistic, meant to be. Human element is unique. Often trader tempted to chase a candle before next one because pivot breached and kept going. This induces stress as you feel your work wasted. Critical long-term: do NOT chase ever. Hard in moment as you feel you’re missing out, but I cannot stress enough: if it works (when you chase), it builds false security in guesswork, and many times if you chase you will be massacred.”

* Taking losses: “Central to success is ability to take disciplined unemotional losses. This concept is difficult as it runs counter to normal psychology. It’s accepting mistakes in real time with a monetary loss – admitting failure. I struggled because I was prideful… would take affront to any trade that didn’t go my way and spend time wallowing, unable to accept failure. Once I got over the hump and religiously took losses understanding they were just technical levels where stock shouldn’t go if trade was right, and if it does then trade wrong and holding would only mean more pain, only then did my trading improve. Dan can help drill this, but ultimately you are clicking the mouse. Taking losses must make sense to you and your ego – only you can execute this.”

* Stop losses in PS60: “For purposes of PS60, stop losses categorized 2 ways: low/high of current 15min candle you entered on, or a 5 minute timer. The current 15min candle stop means if trend was real and buyers/sellers with you, it should never test that level. If it does and stops you out, your level was never truly correct. Using 15min vs 60min candles as stop means you are using a 4:1 risk ratio time-wise (60min of data vs giving 15min chance). 60min data usually enough to confirm price or not. Caveat: use common sense, if trading extended candle on a high-dollar stock and the 15min high/low is $6 away, then no, use common sense – don’t use a $6 stop loss.”

* 5-minute timer (for high beta): “We know these pivots work, what we don’t know is how much they work for. So we must employ a reasonable stop system to save us when wrong. The 5 minute stop timer is applicable to a group of stocks such as high beta. This timer cannot be used with slower moving stocks (they require more time to build and prints). High beta has enough juice inherently to tell you immediately if you are right or wrong. If within 5 minutes of trade you are not on correct side, chances are over 1000 trades you won’t be, so probability not your friend – best to get out and look for next pivot. The loss you take in 5 mins on high beta shouldn’t be substantial (could be exceptions but generally scratch or small). Any failure to abide by risk management and stops will mean utter failure for all prep you did. The resulting permutations of not following a stop are grave and it won’t matter if you charted 5 hours the night before… If you cannot admit you are wrong, trading will make you pay for it monetarily and psychologically. It’s important to stay in business.”

* Bollinger bounce trade: “In addition, on top of trading confirmation of 60min candles, the system can also be used to apply to buying/selling top of Bollinger band ranges as a bounce/fade play. This kind of trading is more acute and particular and takes more deft, as the stop is the high or low of that candle and the 5min timer cannot be applied. Since this type is a bounce/fade, risk management rules a bit more hairy and taking gains also the same. Important to consider market environment and how extended a candle is when doing this. Also watching order flow is important. For example if SPY is dumping 20 handles and your stock reaches bottom of 60min Bollinger, it’s probably not a good trade and won’t work. Also if a stock just had a giant candle and hits the top of Boll band and looks like all buyers no pullback – that probably isn’t a good short.”

* Watching it Build (order flow at pivot): “Watching it build is probably the most difficult aspect for a beginner mechanically. After charting and alignment and setting an alert at price, that doesn’t mean you can blindly go in when alert hits. This is where novices vs experienced differ. Once alert hits, being able to look at Level 2 and seeing big bids/offers being taken is the definition of ‘letting it build.’ It’s not a time concept (not ‘watch for 3 minutes’), it’s an order flow recognition by eye of how fast bids/offers are taken at that price – could be 1 second, could be 5 minutes. The only exception is high beta where you can stop-limit yourself in without watching it build because those names inherently have volume; but for every other stock, just because it triggers does not mean it’s executable. If pivot is 103.24 and it triggers on just 100 shares, that doesn’t mean it’s a pivot. Size must be done at 103.24, .25, etc. to mean actual buyers are there to push it. Again, trading is about aligning as many clues as possible to lower probability of failure. The longer the stock is above/below the pivot, the better your chances. Remember it’s not where you entered, it’s whether it is building above or below the pivot. You also should not chase if it’s gotten too far away. If pivot was 103.24 and you saw big offers taken at .24, .25 and now stock is 103.40 – NO you should not enter 16c late. You will miss pivots a lot, just nature of game. Execution is hard in sense that once alert goes off, you have to quickly judge level 2 whether it’s building, manage stops (current 15min high/low or 5min timer) and take gains.”

* Taking Gains: “Assuming criteria met and you’re fortunate to be in a winning trade – now must manage a winner. This is more art, but from experience and what Dan taught: on the first push (negotiable what one deems a push), a good idea is to sell 1/2 or 1/4. All while being mindful of your stop as well. Next, if you are still lucky enough to be in a winner, sell another 1/4. This leaves you the elusive runner. Ah the runner – the bastion of success of a good trade. It means you made money on 2 executions. At this point, your stop should be moved from technical level (15min candle high/low) to your entry (breakeven). The purpose is to be at break even as much as possible, as if your runner gets stopped it was never going to keep going within defined risk. If the runner keeps going (and these can really run), then you’ve made a correct mechanical trade from A-Z… Congratulations, you just made money on 1 trade.”

* Whole/Half number nuance: “Appendix – Nuances of Whole and Half number: these are like safe zones in freeze tag. These numbers have higher probabilities of confirmation because generally the trading public may also be there (human or algo). Buying/Shorting at a whole number gives higher chance of success than at 103.67, for example. Trading at 104 for breakout is better, though doesn’t mean 103.67 isn’t valid pivot. Point is whole numbers have more emotion behind them.”

* Personalizing system: “Much material discussed. The personalizing of a trading system like this is only applicable to how well the trader follows it. If one is following perfectly but also trading 10 other systems on side, well your ability to be a good trader probably won’t matter. In contrast if one already has a comfortable disciplined process, adding nuances of this system to it can help. It’s about process and respecting it as way to make living. What I learned past year is not trading (sitting out) and only trading good process trades is also a skill. It means one doesn’t have the anxious feeling of always needing to be in a trade or trading subpar setups. It’s like driving a fast car – if you don’t know what you’re doing on sharp turns you’ll likely crash. Trading is the same – if this is the process you use, you must own it and abide by it religiously. The ins and outs as well as psychological makeup of the trader are ever-changing, so constantly working and being familiar with it will be a lifelong journey.”

*(This detailed piece essentially covers everything – we used many of these insights in our guide, and the lines above confirm them. It’s a treasure trove for anyone who wants the rationale behind the rules.)*

**5\. Yanni’s TradingView script description (2021):**

* “My take on PS60 by Dan Shapiro and SamC. The theory relies on each moving average/bolly band acting as supply and demand on that time frame. Everyone can trade this strategy differently but I look for bounce levels in strong names and also breakouts on the 1HR and daily charts. I highly recommend you watch ‘access a trader’ on YouTube to understand further. My take on this indicator is using EMA/SMA clouds as supply and demand to clean up the chart and make price action a little clearer by having some transparency.”

*(Confirms moving averages as supply/demand and mentions both bounce and breakout approaches, aligning with our bounce discussion.)*

**6\. Reddit comment (user JohnTitor\_3) – an ORB strategy (5min opening range) not exactly PS60 but conceptually similar:**

* “5min opening range break… shows me where opening support/resistance liquidity is… After first 5min candle closes I draw lines at high and low. Then wait for price to breakthrough either high or low. After strong breakthrough I wait for price to come back and re-test the breakout level. I look for strong buyers/sellers (wicks or engulfing off that level) and enter. Take profit double risk, stop just outside wick or outside 5min candle if no wick. Example trades… It is a great strategy, works really well and provides setups every day… breakout level is automatically set each day (high/low of first 5min) so no guess or agonize where S/R is, makes for stress-free trading.”

*(Not PS60, but interestingly the philosophy is similar: using opening range, clearly defined levels, stress-free execution once level set. We include this to show the universality of letting price levels guide trades, which PS60 does on 60min scale.)*

**7\. StockTwits user post (from Medium/Blog):** Not directly quoted above, but one line stands out on risk:

* “Results, twenty-plus years of experience, and a one-of-a-kind process designed to help traders become consistently profitable in any market. \[It\] simplifies trading by focusing on the seven 60-minute candles… identify setups long before trade confirms, helping assess and mitigate risk while maximizing gains… you’ll receive Dan’s live pivot feed which helps spot opportunities in real-time. Unlike alert services that manipulate participation, Dan provides setups focusing on technical analysis and price action, meaning you’ll only receive potential moves in your best interest.”

*(This supports that Dan doesn’t do pump alerts – he just calls technical levels, consistent with process teaching.)*

These transcripts and excerpts back up the strategies and rules presented in this guide. They allow you to verify any point and see how the methodology has been communicated by Dan Shapiro and his community.

For complete transcripts of the **4-hour Masterclass** or specific YouTube videos, one would need to watch those resources (some transcripts are accessible via YouTube’s CC feature). Due to length, we have not printed all here, but the key points from those are echoed in the materials above.

**In closing,** use this Appendix as a reference library. If uncertain about a rule, the answer is likely in Dan’s own words above. With study and practice, you will internalize the PS60 Process such that these rules become second nature – and that’s when you truly make the process *your own*, as Dan encourages. Happy trading\!
